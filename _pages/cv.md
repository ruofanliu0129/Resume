Education
======
* Visiting Researcher @ Stanford Computational Imaging Lab, Stanford University, now
  * Advisor: Prof. [Gordon Wetzstein](https://stanford.edu/~gordonwz/)
  * Research Topics: Generative AI · Large Foundation Model · Content Creation
  * Fine-tuned the **Wan2.25B video generation model** with synthetic videos for instructional content creation and human motor forecasting, leveraging distributed GPUs (Stanford Marlowe).
  * Integrated visual-language inputs, LLM agents, and other **foundation models** to propose an interactive system for sensorimotor understanding and embodied interaction.
  * Generated and inferred 3D garment and fabric properties from a single image by fine-tuning a **VLM**.
    
* Ph.D. and M.E. @ Computer Science, Institute of Science Tokyo, Oct. 2021 - now
