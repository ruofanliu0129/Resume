## Virtual Sand Table Display Based on Somatosensory Interaction
* Introduction: [PDF](https://ruofanliu0129.github.io/Resume/files/VirtualSandTable.pdf)
* We propose to creat a virtual sandbox and then perform a series of operations on it through somatosensory interaction, including the 2 change of perspective, multi-directional observation, and the movement of war chess units. The whole project is divided into three parts, creation of sandbox model, rendering of the virtual scene, and definition of somatosensory interaction.
 
## Research on Cross-subject Emotion Recognition Model Based on Domain Generalization
* Introduction: [PDF](https://ruofanliu0129.github.io/Resume/files/DomainGeneralization.pdf) (to be updated recently)
* In order to solve the accuracy loss caused by the individual differences of physiological signals, transfer learning has become a popular research direction in the cross-subject brain-computer interface system in recent years. Domain generalization is an algorithm in the direction of transfer learning in deep learning. This research is based on previous works, and is trying to optimize Domain Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) and Domain Residual Network (DResNet).
